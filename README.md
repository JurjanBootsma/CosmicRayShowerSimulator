This repository contains code for simulating cosmic rays. It is able to simulate the effect of an high-energy gamma ray photon interacting with molecules in the Earths atmosphere. This results in a cosmic ray shower containing of many more photons, electrons and positrons, that all undergo Brehmungstrahlung and pair production.
